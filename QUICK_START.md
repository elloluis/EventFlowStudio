## What Folder to Upload?

**Upload the `/app/frontend` folder** - this contains:
- All your React components
- Styling (Tailwind CSS)
- Configuration files
- Everything Vercel needs!

## Important Notes

- The `/app/frontend` folder is your entire website
- Don't upload the `/app/backend` folder (you don't need it)
- Vercel is FREE for this type of project
- Updates are automatic when you push to GitHub
